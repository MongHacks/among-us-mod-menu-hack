<h2>Among Us is the Perfect Game for Using Hacks</h2>

Among Us has existed since 2018, but has only now gained prominence among groups of friends — and strangers. According to the data analysis portal Sensor Tower, on September 14 the mobile version of this game reached 86.6 million downloads in the Play Store and the App Store. Popularity grew as several streamers in the gaming field began broadcasting the game on platforms such as YouTube and Twitch. 

A match can take place between a group of friends and with random strangers and usually lasts a few minutes. The ship is occupied by crewmates —the good guys, let's say—and impostors. Unlike crewmates, who have to perform simple tasks to reactivate the ship, impostors aim to annihilate the rest discreetly. Along the way, they can sabotage the ship, creating hustle and hindering the performance of the remaining players. The impostor looks the same as the rest, which makes it difficult to identify them. 

Deep down, it's a team game. The only setback is that the impostor may be undercover in that group. So distrust reigns. Although the essence is "good" versus "bad", here each player is on their own.
